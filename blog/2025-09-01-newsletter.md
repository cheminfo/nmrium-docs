This trimester brings two powerful new features to NMRium!

1. **Multiple customizable insets** – You can now add as many insets as you like, and easily resize, rescale, and customize what each one displays, giving you greater flexibility and clarity in spectrum analysis.

2. **Direct 1D–2D assignment** – NMRium now lets you assign 1D spectrum directly from the 2D spectra by linking a 1D multiplet in the 2D plot to its corresponding atom, streamlining and simplifying the assignment process
