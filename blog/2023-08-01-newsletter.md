Hello,

NMRium provides a convenient way to process NMR spectra directly in the browser - eliminating the need to install specialized software. Simply visit www.nmrium.org to get started.

The latest version of www.nmrium.org includes the following enhancements:

1. You now have the **possibility to cut integrals**, allowing you to draw a wide integral and efficiently cut it after (shift + click).

2. **The label of the molecule will now be displayed** underneath the floating molecule and will be included in the reports.

3. **A new method of displaying peaks has been implemented**; peak labels are now visible at the top of the screen, although the option to switch back to the previous mode is still available.

We are committed to enhancing NMRium. If you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
All the best,
The NMRium team
