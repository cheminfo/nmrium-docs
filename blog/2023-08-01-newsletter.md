NMRium provides a convenient way to process NMR spectra directly in the browser - eliminating the need to install specialized software. Simply visit www.nmrium.org to get started.

The latest version of www.nmrium.org includes the following enhancements:

1. You now have the **possibility to cut integrals**, allowing you to draw a wide integral and efficiently cut it after (shift + click).

2. **The label of the molecule will now be displayed** underneath the floating molecule and will be included in the reports.

3. **A new method of displaying peaks has been implemented**; peak labels are now visible at the top of the screen, although the option to switch back to the previous mode is still available.
