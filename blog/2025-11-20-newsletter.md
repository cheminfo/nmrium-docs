This update brings several improvements to molecule management in NMRium, making structure creation, labeling, and importing smoother and more intuitive.

1. **Assignment links multiplets to atoms in the molecule.** Custom labels if defined appear in the spectrum, making reporting straightforward.

2. **Fast atom labelling is now available** — just press space or enter a custom label to number or name atoms directly, making assignment in natural product studies quick and consistent.

4. **Molfile imports has been improved to deal with custom atom labels.** NMRium recognizes atom labels that are placed in ZZC, 'A' alias or 'V' value molfile fields
