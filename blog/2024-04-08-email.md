title: Structural elucidation by NMR and Hints

Teaching NMR spectrometry to a big group of students is tough. You want the students to solve structural elucidation problems on their own. Yet, you can't explain the reasoning to each one.

In this new update of www.nmrium.org we propose a middle ground. The students can ask for hints to help them find the right answer. However, we want them to be aware of the number of wrong answers or hints they have asked for, and therefore, we display corresponding badges (red for wrong answers and orange for the number of hints).

You may try by yourself and give us feedback. You are of course free to share all the series available on https://www.nmrium.org/teaching but we can also assist you to create your own series. Currently 2 series propose hints:

Simple 1D exercises
1H of solvents and simple molecules
All the best,

The NMRium team
