NMRium allows to view and process 1D and 2D NMR spectra. It is a fast evolving project and sometimes the documentation does not follow at the speed we would expect.

Thanks to this new website, constructed using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), anybody can contribute quickly and efficiently to the NMRium documentation.
