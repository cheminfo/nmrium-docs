NMRium provides a convenient way to process NMR spectra directly in the browser, eliminating the need to install specialised software. Simply visit www.nmrium.org to get started. If you have new feature requests, please do not hesitate to contact us !

The latest version of www.nmrium.org includes the following enhancements:

1. Advanced 1D and 2D **mouse zoom**.
   For more information, [click here](/help/zoom-and-scale) to visit the documentation.
   Use SHIFT and scroll wheel for horizontal zoom
   Use CTRL + click + move for horizontal and vertical zoom
   Zoom in horizontally and vertically at the same time.

2. **Assign 1D spectra from 2D**. You can now directly assign the 1D spectrum from the 2D. NMRium will also suggest the assignment for crosspeaks.
