Hello,

NMRium provides a convenient way to process NMR spectra directly in the browser - eliminating the need to install specialized software. Simply visit www.nmrium.org to get started.

The latest version of www.nmrium.org includes the following enhancements:

1. Improvements in baseline correction:

- Automatic identification of zones related to the baseline

- Resize and suppression of baseline zones


- Visualization of the zero as a yellow line
