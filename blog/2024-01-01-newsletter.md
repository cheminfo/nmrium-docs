NMRium provides a convenient way to process NMR spectra directly in the browser - eliminating the need to install specialized software. Simply visit www.nmrium.com to get started.

The latest version of www.nmrium.com includes the following enhancements

1. For a range (multiplet analysis), you can now toggle the display of peaks and integrals. Changing the size of a range will also recalculate the peaks.

2. It is now possible to select spectra in the stack view which is very practical to identify outliers.

3. Other improvements:

- Possibility to display specific parameters like P1, P2 in the spectra panel.

- Speed enhancement by loading all the files in parallel.

- Reading assignments and chemical structures from JCAMP-CX.

- Reading integrals from Bruker files.

We are committed to enhancing NMRium. If you have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

All the best,

The NMRium team
