As someone deeply passionate about online teaching, I've always been interested in creating resources that are not only innovative but also accessible to all, regardless of geographical or economic constraints.

With this in mind, I'm delighted to present NMRium, a browser-based software designed to enhance the teaching of NMR structural analysis. Beyond its accessibility, it also offers an engaging and enjoyable learning experience, injecting both fun and motivation into the process.

NMRium's standout feature is the new 'Hints' system. This intelligent tool guides students towards the correct answer by checking the difference between their proposed answer and the correct one, providing hints without giving away the solution.

Here are some exercises you can start using right away and share with your students:  
A simple series focusing on common solvents found in organic chemistry labs.
