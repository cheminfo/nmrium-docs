# List of Spectra

On the right side of the workspace, various areas are available in an expandable menu. Click onto the field Spectra. The measured nuclei (e.g. ¹H, ¹³C, etc) are displayed in the opened field. The spectra are grouped in nuclei. Click on a nucleus to find the 1D and 2D experiments associated with it. 

To hide all spectra press the icon "hide all spectra". To show all spectra, press the icon "**show all spectra**".

To delete a spectrum, right-click onto the corresponding line in the panel Spectra. A small window opens. Then press delete with the left mouse button. The corresponding spectrum will be deleted. If you want to delete all spectra of a nucleus, open the list of the corresponding nucleus in the panel Spectra by clicking the nucleus with the left mouse button. Then click onto the recycle bin icon on the left above the list. Another window will open. Verify that you want to delete all spectra by clicking on Yes. All spectra of the nucleus will be deleted.
