# Change the Colors

If you want to change the color of a spectrum, click onto the panel **spectra** in the expandable menu. You can change the colour of the spectrum by clicking onto the coloured square in the line of the spectrum. In the appearing window, you can select a different colour. To finish this process, click with the mouse anywhere onto the workspace. For 2D spectra, you have the option to change both the colour of the positive as well as the colour of the negative part.
