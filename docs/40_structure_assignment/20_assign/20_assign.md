# Simple 1D assignment

To assign molecules in NMRium, follow these steps:

1. **Multiplet (Ranges) Analysis**:  
   Begin by analyzing the spectrum to identify multiplets (ranges). You can do this by pressing <kbd>r</kbd> and clicking on the **Auto Ranges Picking** button.

2. **Load the Molecular Structure**:  
   Import or draw your molecule. You can then let it float over the spectrum.

3. **Assigning Ranges to Atoms**:

- Hoevering a range will show a link icon. You should click on it if you want to assign this range. Alternatively you can click on the link in the ranges panel.
- Then, click on the atom(s) in the structure that correspond to that range.
- Diastereotopic atoms can be expanded for selective assignment by holding <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> and clicking on the atom.

4. **Visual Feedback**:

- Atoms and ranges with a yellow background are assigned.
- Clicking on an assigned atom or range highlights the corresponding assignment across panels.
