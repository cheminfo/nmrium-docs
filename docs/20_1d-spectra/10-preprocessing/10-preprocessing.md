## Zero filling

To prepare the FID for the Fourier transformation, click the Zero filling button to the left of the spectrum. You can choose the number of points and the filter line broadening. Then press the apply button.

:::tip **Size** and **LB** values

If you are not sure which values to set, you can use the following recommendations as a reference:

**Size**: Choose twice as many points as in the original FID.

**Line Broadening (LB)**: Specify 0.3 Hz for ¹H spectra and 1-3 Hz for ¹³C.
