## Automatic integration

You mark a signal by simultaneously holding down the <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> key and the left mouse button and moving the mouse over the range of the signal. After releasing both keys, the integral of the signal appears. On the right side of the screen, under the "Integrals" tab, a list of all integrals is listed. If you move the mouse over the shift of the integral in the spectrum, the corresponding entry is displayed in the list. If you move the mouse over a certain line in the list, the corresponding integral in the spectrum is marked.
