## Manual

You can perform zero-order and first-order phase correction.

For zero-order phase correction, move the pivot point (red line) by one click anywhere in the spectrum and select the highest peak. Then click and hold the green PH0 button above the spectrum. By moving the mouse to the left or right, you can perform phase correction until the signal is correctly phased and release the button.

The first order phase correction is performed analogously by pressing PH1. The focus should be on the signals that are as far away as possible from the signal under the pivot point. Clicking the Apply button completes the phase correction.
