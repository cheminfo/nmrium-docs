title: Create a Document
---

Documents are pages with a **sidebar**, a **previous/next navigation** and many other useful features.

## Create a Document

Create a markdown file at `docs/my-doc.md`:

```mdx title="docs/hello.md"
---
title: Hello, World!
---

## Hello, World!

This is your first document in **Docusaurus**, Congratulations!
```

A new document is now available at `http://localhost:3000/docs/hello`.

## Add your document to the sidebar

The document will be automatically added to the sidebar based
on the file hierarchy.

## Setup screen for snapshot (still or animated picture)

For 1D spectra except if otherwise specified we will always use the spectrum of ethylbenzene.
