title: Getting started

All contents of the documentation are hosted on GitHub. In order to contribute to the documentation, all you need is a GitHub account. You can register for free [here](https://github.com/signup).

Then follow these steps:

## 1. Fork our repository

In order to contribute, you do not need any access rights to the repository. You can simply create your own working copy by **forking** the repository. To do so, please visit our GitHub repository:

https://github.com/cheminfo/nmrium-docs

Then, click the **Fork** button in the upper right corner of the window:

## 2. Edit and commit

Once you have created your fork of the repository, you can start editing the pages on your fork. All pages are written in **Markdown**, a very simple format allowing you to include formatting, links, images, and more to your text. A good overview of formatting options is on [this page](docs/90_contribute-to-doc/50_markdown_features/50_markdown-features.mdx).

To **edit** a page, you can simply navigate to the page and click the **pencil button**:

To save the changes to the forked repository, you have to issue a **commit** (which is the equivalent of saving changes in GitHub). In the web interface, you can use the commit section at the bottom. In order to commit changes, you have to leave a short commit message:

![Commit](./commit.png)

## 3. Create a pull request

Your fork allows you to edit as much as you like or even play with things without breaking the live instance of our documentation. However, at some point to may want to contribute your changes to go online on our website.

To do that, you need to create a **pull request**. To do so, go to the **Pull requests** tab of the repo. Then click the **New pull request** button:

![New pull request](./pull_request.png)

A comparison of the differences between your fork and the origin repository will appear. You can continue by clicking **Create pull request**.

In a last step, you will have to enter a short message (like when committing) with your pull request, before you can finalize by clicking **Create pull request**:

## That's it!

We will then review your request and accept it or get in touch with you if we have any questions.

Thanks in advance for your collaboration and enjoy!
